Sanitize
========
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/adamnbowen/sanitize.png)](http://travis-ci.org/adamnbowen/sanitize)

Sanitizes arbitrary objects and arrays, and provides an object interface for accessing the sanitized objects and arrays.

Usage
-----
```php
<?php
use Sanitize\Sanitize;

$sanitized = Sanitize::clean($_POST);
$sanitized->foo; // == a sanitized $_POST['foo'] OR null
```

Installation
------------
Install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), by first adding the following in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "adamnbowen/sanitize": "0.3.*"
    }
}
```

Then run `php composer.phar install` in your terminal to download and install Sanitize.  Make sure to require the `vendor/autoload.php` generated by Composer, and you should be good to go.

TODO
----
* Test injection of objects into Sanitize
* Test __PHP_Incomplete_Class fix

Changelog
---------
* Sanitize::Clean() is now Sanitize::clean()
* Filtered has been renamed to Proxy()
* Proxy is now iterable, so you can foreach over sanitized objects/arrays
* !empty() is no longer called on valuesâ€”Sanitized objects will retain values of `false`, `0`, etc.
